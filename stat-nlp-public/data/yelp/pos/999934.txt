My favorite Thai spot. Not as spicy as other places but that's just fine by me. Their service is phenomenal. One time they were serving cake "just because" and gave me a slice with my pick-up order. Little touches like that make me love them. Their food is fresh and flavorful and the noodles are never soggy on my pad see ew. I just wish they served coconut rice and then it would be perfect!!! (I've asked them a couple times, too!)
