This place is rad! Dueling pianos, happy hour till 8, $3 wells and $4 drafts, and fish bowl long islands... Heartburn may ensue post adios/long island iced tea but it is well worth it.There was great dancing and i loved that the piano singer and performers really get the audience involved- what else would you need on a Friday night? Come by if your on Mill Street, it's right by Gordon Biersch and guarantees good music and fun times! A great place to take a shy friend for their birthday.
