My group did a lot of research on fine dining locations for our recent Las Vegas trip and we decided on Twist at the Mandarin Oriental on a Saturday evening. Needless to say, it was one of the best culinary experiences we've ever had. 

Everything from the friendly and attentive service, the modern decor, the view of the Strip, the eclectic music playing in the background, and of course the food was amazing. Well deserving of 5 stars. 

Our table ordered the course meals and dessert. There just aren't any words to fully describe how delicious the food was. I will say that the American Wagyu steak I had ruined just about every other lesser steak I've ever had. There is no going back. 

If you're in Vegas and want to experience fine dining in on the Strip in a Michelin star restaurant, look no further than Twist. The Mandarin Oriental Hotel itself is probably the best hotel on the Strip as well.
