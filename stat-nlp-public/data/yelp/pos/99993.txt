Hands down the best Thai food in Charlotte. Restaurant is relatively cozy and tastefully decorated. Service is attentive and rather impeccable but the food is the true standout. 

Though I've never been to Thailand (yet), I've been quite an aficionado of Thai food since I first discovered this wonderful cuisine in the late 80s. Thus, I cannot attest to authenticity, just to taste. 

Every item I tried was perfectly cooked, flavorful and vibrant. I strongly recommend the som thum (green papaya salad) as we'll as the fresh summer rolls. For dinner I had trouble deciding which entree I enjoyed the most. It's a total draw:  I really loved all the entrees I shared.  The pud Thai (that's how it's spelled there), the pineapple fried rice, and the red curry with pineapple were all wonderful. And mango sticky rice for dessert was a befitting end to a terrific meal. 

This was my first visit but I plan in becoming a regular. I can't wait to return.
