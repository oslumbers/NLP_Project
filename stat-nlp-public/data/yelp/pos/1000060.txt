Haha.. They say you have to have nice shoes to get in; at least the guys do. No sneaks..But my homie had FLIP FLOPS!! Yeah, BOYEEEE!! And my other homies had on Pumas and Adidas! That's how we do it! Ok, so we're not that cool, but maybe we are? The bouncers really do check out your sole attire.. I was looking at where their eyes were wandering. HAHA.... Oh Vegas... 
The place is pretty dope. Kinda space age-y.. I think they could have done a LIL better with their interior, but you know what? The AMAZING view of the city makes up for it. I went straight outside, despite the FUCKING FREEZING weather...
Oh yeah, the DJ sucked. HAHA.. but we had fun cuz we didn't have a hard time gettin' in, we didn't pay a dime, and ALL the bouncers were cool as all hell...
Check it out..
