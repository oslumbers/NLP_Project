I always find the cutest earrings here.  

I have little hide and seek earrings,  I might have made that up... they are, for instance an alligator, face in the front of your ear and the tail in the back of your ear.... make sense?
I have about 5 pair so far.  Think they are adorable.  

I also find an adorable backpack.  
And 2 notebooks I adore.
