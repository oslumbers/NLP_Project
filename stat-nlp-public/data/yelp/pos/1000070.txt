This place is our go to Chinese restaurant.  The food is so fresh and tasty.  We come here once a week and usually get four things.  For $30, we get dinner there and pack it up and get two more meals at home!  We are vegetarians who do eat fish occasionally and they accommodate us and even make suggestions.  The Kung Pao fish fillet is superb as is the vegetarian soup and lo mein.  If I had anything that they could fix it would be to add two tea bags to the pot of tea to make it stronger and give a bigger amount of the crunchy noodles with the soup.  Other than that, this place is a real great addition to the west valley.
