Excellent DJ.  Hired Don for our company holiday party; he was very communicative prior to the event, arrived early to make sure everything was set up in time, and was friendly and helpful throughout...making announcements, taking music requests, keeping guests on the dance floor.  It's clear he enjoys his work and cares about doing it well!
