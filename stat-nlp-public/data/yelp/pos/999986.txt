I work in Northfield. Occasionally I get lunch at Lin Garden. I don't know how it came to be, but I decided to try every lunch item. Well, mission accomplished. I have had L1 to L27 on my personal Lin Garden menu. Every one was delicious. When I went to the restaurant with my menu to show the girl my take-out menu with all the items checked off, she told me "you have an old menu, now we have 28 lunch entrees". So my old menu is full and now I'll order L28. Got a new take-out menu too!
