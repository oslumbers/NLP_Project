The pizza here is DELICIOUS.
Get the White pizza. 
Be prepared to wait in a forever long line though, esp during peak hours on the weekends (around 1-3). That's when a lot of people head over there after leaving Marquee. :) 
If you have a party of four or more, I recommend just getting a whole pie! It's more worth it, and you can take the leftovers to your room. 
Eat outside of Secret Pizza! Like where the pool table is. Lots of couch seating available. 
The secret is out (actually, has been for a while), Secret Pizza is the best spot to grub (after Earl's) after a night filled with sweaty dancing and pounding down shots.
