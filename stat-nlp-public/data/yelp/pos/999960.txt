I love shortbread and the cookies here are good. About $1.20 apiece, I think, depending on how many you buy. This is a small shop - not much bigger than some walk-in closets - but they seemed to have several staff to help you find what you need.

They have little samples for you to try many of the flavors, and the variety is impressive: coconut, coffee, plain, macadamia nut, Iilikoi, and more... some dipped in dark or white chocolate, too.

I picked up a box to take home (sadly, no chocolate-dipped ones for me since it is summer).

At the time of this review, there were some big stand-up signs around the Grand Canal Shops that had "secret words" on them that you could say to get a free cookie. Look for those green and brown deals with white lettering.
