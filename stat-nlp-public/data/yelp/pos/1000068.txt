Omigosh - this place is sooooo beautiful! It's so peaceful and serene and absolutly worth the trip. Make your reservation for around sunset and prepare to be dazzled. 

Combine the best view on the strip with really a great drink menu and superior service and you are an asshole if you complain about the price. Really. Shut up.
