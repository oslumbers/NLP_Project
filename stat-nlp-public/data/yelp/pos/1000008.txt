When I walked in, I saw many tables were occupied, including sushi bar. This is a good sign. We were offered to the table on the patio. Luckily the weather was already cooled off at night.

The service is nice and the food came out very fast even though the restaurant was packed.

I love their pork Katsu curry. The rice is perfectly cooked. The pork Katsu is perfectly deep fried and has great texture. The curry is the best one I ever have. It is simple but complex in flavor. The pickle helps put all the flavor together.

We ordered some nigiri and rolls. The scallop nigiri is so good. The scallop is firm and dry. It is hard to find other place that can prepare the scallop like this. Thumb up!

The plum and shiso roll is interesting. It is tasty and refreshing. The tsubugai shellfish nigiri is also good. It is so crunchy good.

We were full so we got matcha marron cake to go. The tiny cake with red bean, cream, and match cream on top is so delicious.

I like their indoor water fountain, and they have many Tanuki in different size around the restaurant.
