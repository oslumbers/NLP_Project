Great Pizza - Margharita pizza was excellent. 
Great Decor - Simple yet classy.
Great Service - Owners/Employees were very nice.
Great Fresh Food - You can taste the fresh!
Bad Location- I foresee a more in the next year or so. 
They do not have Mt Dew ... bad - Everyone cannot be expected to.  

This is one of the reasons I love YELP. There is a Zero percent chance I would have gone here. I am never in the area, would have never noticed it and never heard of it. 

Now, I will be taking my family there and telling everyone about it.
