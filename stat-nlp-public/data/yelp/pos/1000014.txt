I was anticipating their grand opening since a friend of mine said their wings are bomb.com!

It was a 30min wait on a Sunday, and when my party was finally seated, we ordered: The large wings (half & half), Fries, Bulgogi Sliders, and Japchae.

Japchae was okay. A bit oily than what I'm used to, but it was tasty.

Fries were pretty good, but they were quite pricey. 

Bulgogi burgers were just OK. It didn't really taste like Bulgogi, but it was filling.

Now the wings..... The soy garlic was good, but the spicy sauce was my fav! It's not too strong of a spice, but I liked the sweetness of it & would maybe ask them to double up on the sauce next time (if possible).

The texture of the wings.. It's not your typically "fried wings". The texture is different than most. It's crunchy & just deep fried goodness.

It was a little oily for me though, BUT, it was really good! =)
