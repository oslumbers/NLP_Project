Great tour! Easy to schedule and very enjoyable! Worth every penny...Kevin our Tour Guide is one of the best! If you get a chance do it! I really, really recommend it! It was long, but you won't get tired or bored, so much to see and very informative...very small but I think it's better that way. Two thumbs up.
