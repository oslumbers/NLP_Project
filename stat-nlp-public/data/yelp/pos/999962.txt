Great service, great environment. Farah was super nice..

Food could be better.  The side of beans was cold, has to sent for reheat...  the side fries was soggy and could have been fried a little longer for that crunch.   Some improvements in the kitchen needed but food was OK.

Prices are unbeatable and would go there again for Breakfast
