Had the chicken tacos.  They were really good, along with a side caesar salad.  They were good.  I asked for a suggestion of a beer, and the waitress suggested the Pale Ale made for Earl's (I can't recall the name).  I totally ignored her and asked for an Alexander Keith's IPA.  She kind of looked at me alarmingly.  In the past couple of months, I have noticed that the staff in bigger cities are starting to do a good job of knowing what good beers are.

We were here on a Sunday afternoon.  Not crowded.  In fact, I think we were the only people eating inside.  Everyone else chose the patio.  The day manager helped us to understand the trolley and subway system.  He was a great help!

There were these HUGE burgers they were carting out.  I didn't realize this was a chain.  Good service, big food, and it appeared to be a decent beer selection, although it was mostly macros.
