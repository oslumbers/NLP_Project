The Great Dane Brat and Bacon pretzel burger could stun a water buffalo!  Damn, that is a lot of meat for a tofu eating Pacific Northwesterner.  Still managed to wedge in the deep fried Snicker sundae, which was a bit rich in combination with the burger.

Good, diverse menu.  Draft craft root beer was very good.
