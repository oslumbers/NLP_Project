We were out doing some work in Deer Valley and were hungry for some wings. Ray's Pizza popped up so we decided to check it out. Ordered wings and a couple slices of pizza. We were very impressed with the pizza, crispy with great flavor. The wings were finger-licking good! If we lived closer, we'd be regulars at this spot!
