Just tried this place for the first time.  WOW!  It was SOOO yummy!!  The Vietnamese Pork Egg Rolls are delicious and the dipping sauce has an amazing "zing" to it.  The potstickers are crisp with another delicious sauce.  My spicy beef noodle soup was SUPER delicious!  I like spicy food, but didn't find it to be overly spicy...just right.  My Hubby's House Pho was flavorful as well.  You can tell they put time and love into the broth.  The service was fast and friendly.  We will definitely be back for more!!
