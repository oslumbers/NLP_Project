This place is in the same complex as my nail salon but I have not stopped in to this location. I have been to their Scottsdale location and love it!

This location does not disappoint. Service is quick and while they prefer cash, the ATM is on site and they offer a discount if you pay cash so no problem. I had the Nam Sod and ordered it Thai hot and yes it was! I hate when I order "Thai hot" and it comes out just a little fiery. Make me sweat, people! 

The texture was lovely, it wasn't dry and the serving was huge! I easily could have shared it and ended up with two meals out of it. I will definitely make this a post-nail appointment dining spot from now on.
