Okay, I love fast food. Can't help it. Every once in a while, nothing beats the taste if quick fried chicken.

I love the fried chicken at KFC because of the crunchy exterior and the flavor! It is not as greasy as the chicken from Popeyes. It's got the flavor without making your hands smell like grease for days! Also the option of getting grilled vs. Fried chicken is always good to have!
