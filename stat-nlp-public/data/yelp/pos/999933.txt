Just wanted to acknowledge the wonderful staff at Body Revival. I first visited the Spa through a WagJag coupon that I purchased, I was a bit worried that the Spa was far from my house but purchased it anyway. Well I'm so glad I did, I have found a great Spa with great service and staff, the Spa is beautiful. 
Nelly and Liza have been great to me and are wonderful to deal with. They offer a wide range of services in a high-end enviroment.

Services used: laser hair removal, Gelac manicure, Revival pedicure and facial. All great!!!

Highly Recommended!!!
