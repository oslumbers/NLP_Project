I have driven by this area many times on my way back from Target - but I never even knew this place was there!  It's worth stopping by - it's a really cute little spot for breakfast or lunch.  Breakfast items are served until they close (at 3pm).  The staff was really friendly.  The atmosphere is charming, with exposed brick walls, a sliding barn door and quirky décor.  It is actually connected to Metro Pizza next door.  My brother tried the Benicio Del Porko - just for the name alone!  He said it was very good.  I had a turkey sandwich, and was really pleased to see it was made with real turkey that looked like it was sliced right off the bird, instead of just lunchmeat.  And I think they bake their own bread.

Next time you're at Target, instead of going to nearby Taco Bell, or worse - eating in the Target "café" I recommend that you stop by Lulu's.  Small neighborhood spots need our support!
