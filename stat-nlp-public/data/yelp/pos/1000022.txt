Chef Aaron is hands above the rest. His passion and love for baking come through in every bite of his amazingly delicious cakes. There is no other person alive that I would want or trust making my birthday cakes from now until the day I die. And if you haven't tasted his Blackberry Velvet Chambord cupcakes you haven't lived.
