My boyfriend and I love this place! We've only been on a Friday or Saturday night when it is super busy. In this case, come EARLY, otherwise you're standing the whole time. It's a little hole-in-the-wall bar for people who love jazz music. It's always packed and so hard to squeeze in but the energy is great, the service is great and the music is wonderful! I think it's been like an $8 cover the nights we've gone, but it's worth it! We tell everyone about this place!
