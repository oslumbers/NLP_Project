SO GOOOOOOOD

I usually don't review after only one visit, however, I ordered a 5-course tasting menu (Canadian, Cambodian, Mexican influences) regretted not getting the 8-course tasting after my 2nd course, picked up the darn scallop shell to suck down all the sauce on the 3rd course then started furiously texting someone to HURRY UP and ditch work to join me, only to have her show up after I finished my  5th course whereupon I asked the server for another menu so she could get the good stuff too, but the scallop dish wasn't on the regular menu so could they please add that (yes, chef said. How nice!) and then she got a full size app, entree, and dessert I didn't have, so I got to mooch off hers (GAWD so GOOOOD) and end up trying 8 different dishes plus 2 amuse bouche anyway.

End of story: come hungry and order the whole menu w pals if you can (or just get the biggest 8-course tasting menu for yourself) before your stomach starts complaining mid-meal like mine did.
