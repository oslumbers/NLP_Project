My new favorite restaurant in the Robinson area. Large menu, daily specials, huge portions, and good wait staff. This place is always packed and for good reason. The food is fantastic. I always love looking at what is going to the other tables to see what I might get on my next trip there. Give this place a try. Well worth it!!!
