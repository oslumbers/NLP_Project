The atmosphere is fun. There is a huge blender by the bar and fishing boats with tables in them. I saw several plates of the volcano nachos go past and they looked like the would feed 4-5 people. I stayed with a typical club sandwich - it's hard to mess that up. It came with fries and a pickle spear. The music was loud but not so much that you couldn't carry a conversation at the table. Next door is the Margaritaville gift shop where anything Jimmy Buffet or beach related can be purchased.
