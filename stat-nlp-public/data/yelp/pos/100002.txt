Nice atmosphere, good quality and fast service. I will definitely be back. We arrived at 6:15 and only had to wait 10 minutes. We were seated right in front of the noodle making window and it was very enjoyable. The service was super fast and the pork soup dumplings were delicious as was the beef noodle soup (noodles were wonderful). The party of three I was with ordered bubble tea which was very good as well. 

Overall it was a very enjoyable experience and I highly recommend eating here.
