Since the first time I came here, Earl's has been one of my favourite hangout spots. Never in my life would I have thought I'd like a spot full of bay street suits but I really do like this place, a lot.

The drinks are inexpensive and tasty, the service wonderful, the food delicious (though salty) and reasonably price (you can't go wrong with their $13 delicious delicious Earl's burger), and the atmosphere and vibe is trendy without making you uncomfortable. 

Hot waitress help their cause too.
