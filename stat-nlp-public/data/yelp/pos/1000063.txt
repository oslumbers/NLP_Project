This review is not necessarily about this coffee bean in particular but about all of them. These coffee shops are by far the best in existence. I wish they had these where I live. They use only top quality ingredients and I love that they use powders instead of syrups for flavoring. The chai here is brewed in the espresso machine rather than using a premixed blend with steamed milk like most places. These coffee shops seem to only be around in southern California and Vegas. When you see one, make sure you treat yourself.
