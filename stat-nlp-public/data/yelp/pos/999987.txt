This was my first time here, I found it on Yelp because another place didn't have anything available. I called in and they said they could do an oil change right away which was perfect!  The place was clean and I was greeted right away. I asked about the best prices and which coupons would be best to use, Woody was very helpful and gave me a great quote. He let me know they would check the other fluids and give me any recommendations. I liked that he gave me a heads up. 
He came back a little while later with a recommendation, price and also let me know what it would be with the Yelp coupon I showed him earlier. I decided to wait and not do what he recommended. I did not feel pressured or wasn't made to feel guilty for not going forward. 
Great experience overall! Quick, friendly and no pressure. All of the staff was friendly. I will definitely be going back. Thanks!!!
