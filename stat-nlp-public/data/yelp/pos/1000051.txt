I have lived in Charlotte for sixteen years and have jumped around from hair salon to hair salon many times but I don't think I've been to a salon I loved as much as Hair Klaudt.  Other salons charge a lot for just a haircut, and I have very short hair, and most of the time the cut doesn't turn out the way I want it to.  I find Hair Klaudt's prices quite reasonable, especially since I always love how my hair turns out.  Hair Klaudt also has an enthusiastic, hospitable, easy to talk to staff and it feels like they want you to be there, and to talk to you.  And if you're tired of the usual salon decor Hair Klaudt is a nice change of pace with a more alternative look to the place.  I recommend Patrick, he's the best!
