Ok, so admittedly this night was a "once in a lifetime" thing for us.  We were eating at the restaurant and started chatting with the table next  to us. We all hit it off and they invited us to their table at the nightclub. It was right next to the DJ booth on the main floor, and we danced and drank all night! The staff was awesome, and the music was great. We will be back again, but probably not at a table. Unless we can find people to split with. Awesome night, great club!
