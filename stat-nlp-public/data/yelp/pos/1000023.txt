I am visiting in the area and found this on Yelp. It was a VERY good choice!!! Dinner special I got was the shrimp egg Foo young for $8.59 which included fried rice and egg roll...I have enough left for tomorrow as well. It was excellent!! Wish I lived closer... it's hard to find good Chinese in Phoenix area!! I highly recommend it!
