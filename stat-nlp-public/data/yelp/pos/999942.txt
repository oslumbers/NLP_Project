On a nice day, their non-smoking patio can't be beat! Great for brunch. We went here after running the Cleveland 10K, and definitely appreciated the hearty meal. I can recommend the shrimp and grits, and although the biscuits and gravy were also good, I probably wouldn't get them again since the appetizer includes biscuits. They also have an enticing mixed drink menu, a nice beer and wine list, and pecan pie for dessert.
