We haven't been to this location since it was a Pho Mi 99. 

In those days it was rather like the poor cousin of the HWY. 10 location of Pho Mi 99. We drove by and noticed the name change, so we thought we'd give it a try. And we are very happy that we did!

The dining room was very nicely decorated in a contemporary style and seemed very clean. The washrooms were spotless! This is a big deal when it comes to the typical local Viet. restaurant. 

I ordered the beef stew with rice noodles. It was filled with plenty of beef, the noodles were cooked perfectly and the broth was very tasty. 

My husband had the rice with grilled chicken, fried egg and steamed egg. He thought it was all very good and the fried egg was nice and runny. 

All in all we were very pleased with our meals and will definitely be going back.
