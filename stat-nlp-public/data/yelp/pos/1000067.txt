I am stuffed. Filled to the brim with  beer and a delicious burger. 
Does life get better than this? 
Waddling out of this place I tried to think of a place like this anywhere else.
Expect about $10+ for the burger and another $1.50 for fries (burger comes with chips). Burgers have a good size patty and lots of options to building you own, although most premium toppings are $1-1.50, abundant choices of toppings.
Lots of beer choices. Laid back vibe. 
Lots of people having milk shakes, but after a burger with pretzel bun, I'm stuffed. 
Service was great! 
Fortune cookies served with the check...LOL! Hysterical! Seriously? Hahahaha! Laughed all the way to the hotel.
