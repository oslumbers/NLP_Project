This is my kind of place! A 5 star dive bar, trust me, that is a huge compliment. It's not really a dive bar, but it's not some pretentious, gastro pub type establishment either. This is a local bar with local people and great food. Their wings are in my all-time top 5, the beer is fine, it's your standard stuff, the rest of the menu is ... actually, I've only had their wings. I usually stick  with the Dragons Breath and Buffalo Butter, but their baked wings are a game changer, Foghorn Leghorn and Cuban Sun are especially good.

To the people complaining about the size of the wings, you don't know shit about wings! 
First off, the size is good and you order them by weight not amount so it's not like you're getting ripped off. Second, what's more important is how they're cooked and sauced. Third, if you want giant mutant chicken wings that are pumped full of god knows what head down to the States where their regulations are much more laxed on the matter so you can get unnaturally large chicken wings.
