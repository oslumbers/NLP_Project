So I have been driving by this building for close to a month. I finally had a chance to look it up on the Internet. A taiwanese dessert restaurant. I found myself sans-son... (the picky one) and told the wife and daughter where we are going for dessert. Other than being totally overwhelmed by the menu. Our choice was great. We got a Mochi Shaved Ice. Huge for the three of us. Lovely flavors. I will totally recommend this Meet Fresh. I plan to plan my next visit better. Looking forward to trying out the different teas and Jellys.
