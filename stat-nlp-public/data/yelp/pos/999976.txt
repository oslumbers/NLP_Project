Best Buffet Ever. 

Really. Every dish is thoughtful and well considered. Even though food is made in bulk, there's still love and attention that you can taste with each bite. Flavors were very on point. My favorite was the chicken tostada on a crisp tortilla chip. I ate like 3 of those. My favorite dessert was the gelato bar. The thai tea and tiramisu gelato tasted exactly like how it should taste; I was very impressed. 

I'd come back here again in a heartbeat, but it'll have to be on a weekday; the prices are slightly cheaper.
