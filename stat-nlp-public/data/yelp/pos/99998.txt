Wanted a short hair cut but didn't have a regular hairstylist. Hermes was professional, kind, and patient as my hairstylist. He seems knowledgable as I consulted him on how it would look if I were to cut my hair short. He understood my worry as I went from chest length hair to mid-ear short with an undercut (which I've never gotten it that short before). As an Asian with soft and light hair, cutting it short was a dangerous aspect. He made sure he went in stages with the length and asked me what I was comfortable with and if I was feeling satisfied with the haircut throughout the whole time. Loved the cut!
