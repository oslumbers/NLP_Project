Heading to a show on the east side of Phoenix and looked for a place to grab a sandwich. A quick search on Yelp led us to Outta Bronx.

Hubby ordered the Empire Steak, which he proclaimed as "really good" and onion rings. I enjoyed the Cal Chic but opted for fried instead grilled. So much food! But really good food! Next time we will share one sandwich.

The ingredients were fresh and not prepackaged, prebreaded, etc. The bun was fresh and just the right texture. The onion rings had a good taste. And the staff was very friendly.

Our tab for two sandwiches, onion rings and two canned drinks came to $25.50, plus a few dollars in the tip jar.
