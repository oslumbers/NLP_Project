Good Lord what a hot mess this guy is. When he shows up he is awesome.  . .not a bit of poop left on the ground (but isn't that their job?) The problem lies in getting him to show up. His "car problems" outnumber my "dog ate my homework" high school problems ten fold.

Then, when he decides he's going to come to work, he'll text you at ELEVEN FREAKING o'clock at night. Seriously? Do you text YOUR boss in the middle of the night to let him know you'll be at work the next day?

Enough. Seriously -- I've had enough. This is yet another Las Vegas classic and, after almost 15 years of dealing with this crap, I am DONE. Either do what you say you will  do or FU$% off. Thankfully, there are a multitude of dog sh$% pickup services from which to choose. "Skip," (which isn't even your name) you lose.
