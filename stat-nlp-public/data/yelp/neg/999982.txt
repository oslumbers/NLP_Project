Was excited to try new D&B location and ended up being severely disappointed.  The extremely slow service my friends and I received both at the bar and sitting at a table was absolutely ridiculous.   There one drink per person policy is also ridiculous.  Perhaps they should not allow minors in past a certain time then they wouldn't need to enforce such a limiting policy.  Not being being able to buy a round of drinks without everyone being being present and having to show their id is very discouring for me to want to return.  It took over 45mins to get drinks served to our table and at the bar was 10-15 min wait.  All management did was apologize about the policies and the delays.  I highly doubt I will be returning.
