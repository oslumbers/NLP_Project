One of my biggest pet peeves is customer service. While Barolo had excellent service, the vibe was killed by the manager/owner (?) scolding the bartender and wait staff for their every move. Yes, I know that they are new, but the staff were clearly doing an excellent job, and publicly critiquing the staff is unacceptable. I would recommend walking down the hallway and heading to Julep until the the gentleman at Barolo works out the distrusting kinks.
