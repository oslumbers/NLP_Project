Still not impressed with this location..... Next time I will drive all the way across town to the green valley location because for some reason this location can't seem to get it together..... Called in ordered my regular and asked for the beef ribs to be extra burnt.... I get there to pick up an nobody seemed to be working the take out counter.... There was a woman ahead of me that said she had been waiting for over 10 min and still nobody had even acknowledged her so when I saw a waitress walking by I asked her if anyone was working the window she told me this on shell get someone and after another 6 min yes I checked my phone someone finally did show up...  Now, why should people that call in orders to go have to wait another 16 min or longer to pay for their order that is sitting ready waiting to go getting cold just waiting for it to be paid for???? I'm not impressed with the to go aspect of this store....
