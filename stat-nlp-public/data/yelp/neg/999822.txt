When you walk in, this place has a very different feel from the usual Chinese tea restaurants because it's bigger and roomier.  I've sat in the elevated seating area in the back and in the regular dining area, and the former is a lot louder so it's harder to have a conversation there.   

The congee here is not bad, but the beef + tendon flat noodle in soup wasn't good (too many noodles, beef was tough.)  The dim sum here is surprisingly good for the type of restaurant that this is.  The Dynamic Siu Mai gets a thumbs up and is one of Cafe Cogo's specialties, the fried radish was breaded and fried well, and the spring roll is generously filled.

In terms of service, it's about what you expect for a Chinese restaurant.  There was an annoying fly both times that I've eaten here... If he becomes a regular here, I probably won't be.
