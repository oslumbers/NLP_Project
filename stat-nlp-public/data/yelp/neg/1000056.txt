This was my fourth visit to Six Penn and my first with a less than satisfactory meal. My martini was good, the wedge salad was delicious but my entree and dessert were not so good. I had the Short ribs and substituted mashed potatoes for ravioli - mashed potatoes and veggies were good but the meat was very tough, not at all what you would expect for short ribs - chewy and very fatty. 
For dessert I tried the chocolate truffle cake - it was very dry and tasted as if it had been around for a few days. The service was very good, our server was very attentive and friendly. My fellow diners enjoyed their entrees of trout and surf and turf (steak w/crab cake).
