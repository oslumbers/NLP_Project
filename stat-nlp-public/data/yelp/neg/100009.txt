If you are able to check off both boxes you are safe to visit the Tropicana Cinemas without worrying about your future health. 

Don't get me wrong, I've subjected myself to the gum and germ infested seating arrangements, dowsed myself in antibacterial hand sanitizer and sat through an entire movie at this theater. If you do not mind sitting next to the same guy that was panhandling you for money when you first walked in to the theater then you're all set! 

If you are on a tight budget or have a large tribe you're trying to entertain, the Tropicana Cinemas would be a fine choice. But if you are looking to impress your love interest on a first date, this is surely not the way to go.
