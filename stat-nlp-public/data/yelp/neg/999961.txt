I don't know what it was but I usually have good things to say about this bowling ally. Till this Saturday went in around 9 to bowl with family, got our lane ordered some food. Pizza tastes super bland. Ordered the BBQ chicken wrap chicken was super salty masked with the BBQ. My sister ordered the Cesar chicken wrap it was also super salty. French fries came drenched in salt, however they were freshly made. Yep sums up my night
