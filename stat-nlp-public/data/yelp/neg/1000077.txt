I've been here quite a few times and there's always bee one problem but this was horrendous.

Waited 30 min for my drink to arrive.  The food actually came out first.  I asked about it,  they then brought two, one had alcohol in it and one didn't.   Menu say "1.00 off all drafts." They didn't tell us until they brought the bill that Guinness and Stella were not included.  What part of all means there are exclusions.  Horrendous service.

This was just my experience as I was with several other and everyone had an issue
