Enjoyed Guy's show immensely, unfortunately this place was less than stellar. Menu was limited. The food was extremely over salted. The Vegas nachos had salty blue cheese with salty wing sauce. I also ordered the wings which tastes the same so it was salt overload. I will still watch his cool show but he needs to work on the menu.
