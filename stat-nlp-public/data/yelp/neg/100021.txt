Went to this place to buy a car. Signed all paperwork and left with the car. 5 days later they wanted more money down. Told them no and gave the car back. They already had our old car on the Internet for sale and it IS STILL there.  When I asked them to remove it they said it could take days.  Sure didn't take them days to add it when the deal wasn't even done yet. Also they cannot find a remote for the underbody light kit that is on the car. It costs  $50 to replace that and the brain to get it to work again.  

Nate is an old school salesman who treats you like you've never bought a car in your lifetime.  His BS remarks are almost hilarious but condescending as well 

Don't go here.  They are unprofessional and obviously the finance department doesn't know what they are doing if they let you take a $63,000 car off the lot, take your down payment, then have to unwind the deal because of a bad call.
