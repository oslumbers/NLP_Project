I used to frequent this dive during undergrad, before the renovations and when it was "less fancy" so that should tell ya somethin. 

I've done and seen it all here: bar sanctioned drinking contests; thrown out for no apparent reason; couples getting their freak on the dance floor and all sort's of debauchery I don't care to rehash. Anyway last time I dropped in to meet someone I felt terribly out of place. 

There's always been a rumour this place recycles draft beer which was reported by the Star years ago, resulting in a suspended liquor license for a few weeks. 

This Brunny is a right of passage for the 1% of U of T students who like to party while the remainder prefer to study at Robarts Library till past 10:00 on a friday night. If you want "Animal House" this place is for you.
