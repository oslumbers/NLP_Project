All I heard when I first moved to Pittsburgh is how GREAT Primanti brothers is. Well I have eaten and two locations and they have the worst sandwiches I have eaten. EVER!
While no one can deny that french fries on a sandwich is awesome, I think we can all agree that the stale non-toasted bread and runny coleslaw make this sandwich taste like I am eating ass. 
Primanti brothers is a Pittsburgh staple, and Pittsburghers love "their" stuff, but  this is one place they should let die out.
