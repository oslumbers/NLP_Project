Ew this place sucked.  All the Section 8/ ghetto type people infest this mall like a plague.  I was there today and this girl and her 95 children were in the coach store trying to return a purse that she obviously used and wanted to exchange for another style of purse that she could again do the same cycle with.    
Nobody seems to speak a word of English in this place.  Go to the other Outlet center, much classier, nicer layout and less retards.
