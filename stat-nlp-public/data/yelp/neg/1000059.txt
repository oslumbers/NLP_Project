As a former outbound sales agent, this company is nearing scam territory.  All of my leads were years old and when the team wasn't able to produce, we were all laid off.

Or was that due to the point I made an HR claim of sexual harassment a few weeks earlier...we'll never know.  Very poorly ran company with zero regard for employee security.  Don't be fooled.  The long time employees are running the show.  No one is moving up in this small office.
