This is the third time I have eaten at Iron Chef. Its pretty good sushi and its right by my house.  The server next door at Nicks had told me it was dirty and the kitchen was gross. I don't know why but I decided to try it out again.  Immediately my napkin had a long black hair on it...I wasn't too upset just asked for a new plate.  Then my boyfriends plate was sticky...he asked for a new plate...my soy sauce cup had an old piece of rice in it...asked for a new one of those too...the server kept apologizing which was nice but come on...3 dirty things and we haven't even gotten our food yet! Our sushi arrived and it was ok...it wasn't as cold as I would like which worried me.  They gave us a cucumber salad for free...wow thanks. It's decent sushi for a really good price you just have some risks involved when you go there with cleanliness...
