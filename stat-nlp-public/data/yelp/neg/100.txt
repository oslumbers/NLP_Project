They charged me twice what I expected to pay. The guy at the counter small-talked me, asked me if I wanted "any additional insurance" - I said no - and just initialed where he told me to, not noticing that one thing I initialed was collision waiver insurance, which I did not need and ended up doubling the original cost. He did not walk me through the additional cost and may even have been purposely misleading by distracting me with small talk. I am an experienced traveler and nothing like this has happened to me before. When I returned the car and expressed my surprise at the doubled cost they essentially said "well you signed it" and "it's worth it anyway." I will never rent from this Payless again.
