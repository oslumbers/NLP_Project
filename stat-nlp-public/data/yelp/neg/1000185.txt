Oh where can I even start with how horrible this place is!  I rented from this location in March 2016 and it was a mistake...for every six customers the two other rental companies were turning over on either side of Fox (with two employees), Fox was turning over just ONE customer (with three employees)...if you do the math, that just doesn't add up...

I had forgotten about this and made the mistake of attempting to rent from them again this past week (April 7)...the same horribly slow turn-over was encountered and this time I was denied rental because I only had a debit card and didn't have two forms of ID!  (Completely contradictory to what was required in 2016)

So after all that waiting, I had to go to another company...Alamo!  Who I HIGHLY recommend!  They heard about my experience and not only gave me a great rate, rented to me with my debit card and one available picture ID, they threw in free gas!  They didn't have to do that, but did.

Fox=HORRIBLE

Alamo=AWESOME!
