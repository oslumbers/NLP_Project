Rude ass mother fuckers here, if you like being treated like shit then you'll want to come here. Tried asking waitress questions about menu because it had been my first time & she acted like I was wasting her time. As well I ordered an ice tea, & never got it. Then they tried to bill me for that! The food isn't all that great either. I'm very upset with the way I was treated. They all need attitude checks. Litterarly felt like just because I was white they were rude as hell
