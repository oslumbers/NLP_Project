6 of us went there before the Browns game to check out the east bank of the flats. We got there before the rush so one would think food and drinks would be easy to come by. Our first round came pretty quickly (highly recommend the sweet baby Jesus) but it stopped after that. For being there two hours we managed to get two drinks a piece, took over an out to get a stuffed pretzel and some dip and never got our sandwiches. We ended up canceling our food orders and settling for some overpriced stadium dogs. I truly think our server hated his job and didn't give two s&@": about his tables. I only say this because the three tables around us came after us, got all their food and left. I'll give this place a chance again because I liked the atmosphere but the service was horrible!!
