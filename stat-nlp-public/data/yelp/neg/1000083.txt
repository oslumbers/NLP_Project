The customer service is absolutely horrendous. They don't acknowledge you as you enter and the food isn't all that. The owners of the restaurant are really rude. They also own that Asian Market on Rainbow as well. They need to be closed down. I'd rather drive the extra mile to get tastier food and better customer service.
