What a joke. Arriving we where told the kitchen was to busy for 30 min and we couldn't sit down and wait nor even order a coffee. I was floored and couldn't believe in a service business that an owner would have a policy that you couldn't even sit even though the place was half empty. After speaking to the rude staff the rude owner came with his miserable face stating his rules. I tried to explain we would wait but his lordship wouldn't have it. How could this idiot running a small business making brunch have an attitude like this. The food isn't even that good. I guess if you want a high caloric intake and be treated like dirt this dump is the place. There are 100 place better plus the staff and owner make you feel welcomed. Wouldn't eat here for free.
