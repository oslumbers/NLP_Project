Ok so the service at this place is great top notch.  if i was to review based on that a full 4 star easily.

Why we didn't like it and rated at 2:
Ordered there special drink of the day, it was not that great.  BUT being that said, that is not the reason of the low review.  Its not there fault we didn't like the drink (even though the ingredients sounded amazing)

I ordered the chicken catchatorie....way to salty, and for the price not filling.  A salty tomato chicken on some toast....not impressed.  And defn not filling.

My friend had pasta, and it was sorta bland.  The pasta didn't even taste fresh...if i wouldn't know better i would say it was store bought (but assuming its a Jaime restaurant i would assume they make there pasta in-house)

The only things that was on point was the Sangria, and my beer lol.

For the price of this place, the portions was not filling, and not that tasty.  From my salty chicken to my friends bland pasta....i would have enjoyed my self at alice fazooli's or the food court. a lot more.
