I gave them 1 star because there wasn't a no star option. The absolute worst customer service from the young ladies working there. There was no greeting, no other customers, and no courtesy. One of the ladies was smoking in the front door way when we entered, and during check out, the other asked if I had a pen to sign my receipt. To top it off they were walking around without any shoes. I guess no shoes no (customer) service!
