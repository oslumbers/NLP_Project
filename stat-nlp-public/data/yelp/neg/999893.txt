If this restaurant has more than 5 people at a time they don't know what to do! If there's a big group here, just forget it. I went to have lunch and there wasn't a big lunch crowd however there was a large group in the back. I sat and waited to order and no one took my order for 15 minutes and they didn't even notice me. I had to wave down someone (not my waitress) and she added my order to someone else's table! So my food took another 30 mins and they didn't know where to deliver the food so again I had to wave someone down to get my burger. Then! The freakin burger was burnt to a crisp ( I ordered median well). I gave back my food and asked for my check. Thankfully they took off the charge and I left there as quick as I could. Don't ever eat here!
