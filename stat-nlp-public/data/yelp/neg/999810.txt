Came here to get a cake for a birthday. We waited thirty minutes to get somebody to write "happy birthday" on it. The girl came back out and said the staff messed up our cake. And that they did a terrible job and it looked like a two year olds handwriting. She then looked in the freezer and there was no more of the cake we wanted. She said she was going to go and try to fix the bad writing. She was laughing about it the whole time and I didn't find that funny. If she couldn't get the writing on it in the first place, then don't mess up the entire cake and try to give me a cake that has fingerprints in it and messy writing.
