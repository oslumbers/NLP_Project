Terrible customer service. I asked about how long it would be for an oil change and they told me 30-45 minutes. I didn't get my car back for THREE HOURS. Then when I did get it back, the manager thought that by hitting on me, he could convince me to let them do the work they recommended for my car. When I refused, he got all huffy with me. I wouldn't go anywhere else before it changed ownership. Now I refuse to go there!
