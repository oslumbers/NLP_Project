I like this store for many reasons. They carry Boars Head in the deli, the best fresh bread and donuts abd a good meat department. So the shopping experience is good until you reach the checkout. They have a woman ringing customers who is just a nasty old bag who ruins the whole shopping experience. She acts like she's doing you a tremendous favor by ringing up your sale. She is always having a personal conversation with whoever may be hanging around so you are basically ignored when you first walk up to the checkout and then she will continue to talk while she's ringing the sale. Its the stores last chance to leave an impression on their customer and they fail miserably.. Baxk to Frys i guess..
