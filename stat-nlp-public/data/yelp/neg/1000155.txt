Did the restaurant change owners? The front desk is now in the back by the kitchen and the menus have been redone. The prices have gone up another $1-$2 per hotpot and the initial offerings of the starter plate is meager compared to what used to be offered in the past. I noticed the workers referring to the menu several times. 

I ordered the thai hot sour broth and it was mixed with the szechwan spicy broth. Pepper flakes filled the pot and I wasn't up to eating something spicy due to being sick from a cold. The buffet cart of sauces and noodles is still available. 

My milk bubble tea came straight out of the fridge...yum...premade and soggy tapioca bubbles. 

We were given an extra starter plate and had it taken away after the hot pot came out. That plate was placed back into the fridge!
