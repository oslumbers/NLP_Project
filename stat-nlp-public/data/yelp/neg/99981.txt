Unfortunately I had an awful experience with this school. The instructors are very rude and immature.  They have no control over the over crowded classrooms. My instructor,  MaryAnne, was awful. She would tell us at least once a day that it is not her job to teach us to cut hair, its her job to teach us to pass the state board test. For $20,000. It's just  insulting. She was rude, inappropriate, unhelpful, and obviously miserable at her job. I was promised one on one attention and a positive learning environment and I ended up transferring to another school because Avalon was so awful. Please don't waste your time or money at Avalon you will be disappointed. If you need more proof, Make one phone call to that school, and the girl who answers the phone will let you know right away what to expect with her miserable attitude.
