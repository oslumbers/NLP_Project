My husband and I walked in on a Saturday afternoon.  Ordered a double trouble, a cheeseburger and a poutine to go.  There are definitely better burgers out there.  Our patties were pretty much burnt and therefore it was difficult to eat and the cheeseburger was stacked so badly that it was a mess.  The poutine was okay but nothing special.  Overall, if you are hungry and you pass by this place just keep walking.
