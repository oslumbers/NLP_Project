I have shopped at Smith's at Rancho & Charleston for over 30 years.  Recently, I have had several occasions when the food purchased had passed their expiration dates by weeks or in one case 2+ months.  My practice has been to check dates on everything.  But, today was the FINAL STRAW.  The cart that I grabbed was absolutely FILTHY.  I took a picture and then talked to Chris, operations assistant manager.  He told me that they would take cart out of service.  But, it went right back in the mix and someone took it to shop with.
This store has continually gone down hill.  Sadly, no other store is close but I guess a drive is in order.  This store services Rancho Circle, Rancho BelAir, Rancho Nevada Estates and Scotch 80's, some very prestigious neighborhoods.  If corporate doesn't do something, this store is a disgrace to their name.
