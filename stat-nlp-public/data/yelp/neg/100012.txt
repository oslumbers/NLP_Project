This is our regular McDonalds and it wasn't always so bad. It's slow in drive thru and walk in though. 

Today we ordered a double hamburger and only got one patty. Also ordered a Big Mac with bacon and didn't get the bacon. Couldn't complain to them bc we found out when we got home so. 

Only perk is 24 hours lol
