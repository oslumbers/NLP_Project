Showgrow is having some real problems with its cultivators. They do not have real good relationships with cannabiotix or Polaris so these big companies which hold all the best crop in Las Vegas are sending product to Major stores like a Essence  that have a lot of stores. For example today when you look at the menu Essence had over 50 strains when you look at showgrow they have like a dozen. showgrow is going to be muscled out of being player in vegas. with no strains rude floor people and no medical privilege to those coming in the door it's a free-for-all. They will probably stay open because anybody with a pot-shop nowadays has hundreds of recreational people that don't know any better yet
