Horrible! Horrible! You would think a spot like this would be amazing, let alone it was pretty hidden/dark spot of Las Vegas. The outside looked like the place was closed. We continued to go inside and it was empty on a late Friday night. Ambiance was cute though. This is a WARNING! You get a free cocktail/drink when you check in on Yelp. They had their holiday special cocktail drink and lets just say luckily it was free because it tasted terrible! it was either too sweet or tasted like medicine. Obviously the bartender did not know how to mix drinks at all. They messed up my friends "red headed slut" drink the bartender had added Redbull and my friend had to coach the waiter to tell the bartender to never ever have Redbull in a red headed slut. The only thing i enjoy was the Seared Salmon.. to me it was great. To my group of friends they ordered the Bootlegger Strip Steak (dry even ordered it on Medium), 
'Speakeasy' Steak Sandwich (dry),  Shrimp and Lobster Roll (nothing special), Blind Pig Chopped (plain) and Stozzapretti Pasta (was okay).
