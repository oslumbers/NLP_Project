You get what you pay for... sometimes. I dropped off a few shirts and pants last week and when I went to pick them up, a shirt was missing. Steve claimed it had been "held"  though it simply needed basic dry cleaning. He then said "they do this to me all of the time."  When I took my duvet cover in, it took a week and a half longer to return than promised. Overall, very little lack of empathy for their mistakes and poor customer service.
