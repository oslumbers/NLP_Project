I'm sorry to say, but this was THE worst Cirque show I've seen despite being a Beatles fan.  I was extremely disappointed with the lack of acrobatics in the show.  When watching a Cirque show, there's a certain amount of WOW factor you expect.  Unfortunately, the WOW did not deliver since a good 70% of the show is just people dancing around.  Don't get me wrong, I love dancing and watching people dance, but just not at a Cirque production for nearly $100. 

P.S. A kid (maybe 10 years old) was sitting in front of me and was so bored that he started entertaining himself with his PSP for 30 minutes until a staff member annoyingly flashed an extremely bright light at him to stop.
