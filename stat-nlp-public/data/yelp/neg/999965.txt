The 1 star is just for the TV screens showing Football games. 
The service being horrible is an understatement. You experience a level of apathy that is akin to someone doing you a favour by serving you. The person at the counter was downright rude. We were not served for about an hour after we came in, despite speaking to multiple waitresses to take the order. The food (20 wings) took another hour to come in. And it didn't seem like they were understaffed. 
The only reason we stayed was to watch the football game. Do yourself a favour and visit the numerous other restaurants around.
