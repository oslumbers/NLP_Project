Took almost two hours for delivery, spent 70 bucks on barely any food so I'm surprised the money is  two $$ signs. Because we barely got shit. Didn't even come with a side of rice or soup or salad. Nothing. And the sushi we ordered? Never again. Tiny as hell pieces, that were soggy and my husband and I tried a bite, had too throw them away, it was obviously old. Wasted money, and time on shitty barely any food, slow ass service. Thanks, not doing this place again. I'll get my sushi from frys, the grocery store next time, they are better tasting, more fresh, and bigger better pieces.
