I think the rest of the reviews sum it up very well. The ONLY reason they can even operate is the fact they basically have had a monopoly. I have reached my last nerve after years of "fixes" and "new cables being laid" and CONSTANT outages. I have easily lost thousands of dollars because my business couldn't operate and still forced to pay for "high quality internet". This is the most broken company I have ever encountered.
