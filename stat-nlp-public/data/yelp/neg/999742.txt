I tried to book a cab with this company on New Years Eve this year.  The girl that helped me book it at 12:55am that night and was very nice.  She then said the cab will call me 10 minutes before it would arrive.  Not only did nobody call me, but no cab ever showed up.  I tried calling the company several times and every time I called there was a busy tone.  I understand it is a very busy night for all cabs, but this was unacceptable. Will never use this company again.
