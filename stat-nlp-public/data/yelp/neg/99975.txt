I'm not certain why people would pay for this. First day was alright. Second day I showed up no lights on and the instructor was late without any apologies. Aside from that as a new member I expect special instruction to help guide me and not frustrate frequent goers. That was absent and no modifications for those of lower skill level. After the third day one of the trainers left class to grab himself and the other trainer Tim Hortons. They had this while teaching!!! On top of it all no stretching and post workout guidance?!  The workouts are great but this gym needs work. 

The nail in the coffin was an email asking me to confirm my class because other members wanted my spot. If I didn't confirm my trial would be taken. There are far better ways to say that but it's good to know new business means nothing to you. I'll be going elsewhere and referring all else there too.
