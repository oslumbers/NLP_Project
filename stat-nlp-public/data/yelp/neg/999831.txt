This place just opened two days ago. I was so excited that there was finally a ramen place on campus. I got the chicken curry ramen. I was very disappointed with the ramen here. The broth was not anything special nor were the noodles. Within my ramen, I found small pieces of bone from chicken scatter throughout. Also, the chicken tasted very bland with no seasoning at all. Overall, it is great to have a ramen place on campus, but do not expect it to be amazed with the quality.
