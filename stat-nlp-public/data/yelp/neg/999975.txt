Like other reviewers, I really wanted to like this place! But I'm really surprised a bakery wouldn't have a way to slice bread or offer freezer bags. The cashier seemed so annoyed by my asking for the bread sliced that it made me think she must get asked a lot. If customers keep asking, maybe you should get it!! The bread was okay - the flavour was rather blunt and the texture a bit heavy.
