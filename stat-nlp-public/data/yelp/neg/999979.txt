There are not accredited as an ACR Positron Emission Tomography Accredited Facility. My report findings : not as well seen due to technical factors. Well What TECHNICAL FACTORS? I called and someone will return my call. I did my part my insurance paid for technical factors not showing my nodules? I am going to accredited locations only! not wasting my money on knuckle heads!
