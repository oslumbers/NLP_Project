We have been a fairly regular customer at this place for a while. Over our last 3 visits, their service quality and food have deteriorated significantly. Today's visit was the last straw. We sat at our table waiting for basic drink orders to happen for about 10 minutes. Then our food in general arrived much after other larger groups who had come after us. To make things worse, the Kali Mirch ka paneer was completely under-seasoned. They put some undercooked paneer to pass for a tandoor dish with some sprinkled chat masala. We have had this same dish here before and it was my wife's favorite. This was basically nothing like it. Then their spring dosa which I ordered had undercooked cabbage with large pieces of carrots, completely skipped the part where these vegetables have to be finely chopped before stuffing them. Again, no seasoning or salt either in the stuffing for this. 

My favorite at this place used to be Mirchi Ka Salan, however after the last debacle of breads and food orders, I was hoping for a simple south indian meal thinking they cannot goof it up. I guess I was wrong.

I don't think I will go back.
