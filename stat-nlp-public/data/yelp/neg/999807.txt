I'll be honest and say I've never purchased anything in this store.  The problem is that they burn massive quantities of incense throughout the entire store.  My eyes were burning and I had a pounding headache before I was even halfway through the store.  I ended up turning around and walking out because I couldn't stand the smell.  I can't imagine purchasing anything upholstered from that store because I have to think that it would reek of that awful smell forever.
