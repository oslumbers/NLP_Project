Was somewhat leery about this practice at first but after 3 visits where I paid $55 a visit I was told that they wanted the whole treatment plan paid upfront, anywhere between 1300 to 1500.  I have never been asked by a Chiropractor to pay first so I decided to look at my options.  The sad part was on the second visit when I told the office personnel taking my payment I thought $55 was too high she said it would be lower.  The plan they presented was not lower and when I searched on line with my health plan they hadn't submitted any claims yet even though I paid.  I have a high deductible plan and the copays don't kick in until it reaches a certain dollar figure.  I've always had all of my medical visits submitted as a claim whether I paid the full amount or a copay.  This is really disconcerting and I waited to write this review to give them time to submit the claims but nothing as of today.  Really not sure what to think at this point but that was my experience.
