After several years of being hounded for feces tests during vacinations (and declining my cat was fine) I came to need blood tests for medication. Once diagnosed the vet clinic insisted we have blood tests every 6 months otherwise they would withold the medication. 200 bucks a pop.or 400 bucks a year.  Exthorting funds for what became very clear totally unnessesary testing. Hey i get it, they are running a business.

Testing your pet when something is obviously wrong makes sense. When everything  is A-Okay? 

Taking our pet and our money elsewhere.
