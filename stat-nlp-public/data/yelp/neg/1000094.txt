Where do I start. Do your research on these folks. I have lived in Hidden Canyon Village 3940 Scott Robinson Blvd, for over 3 years with no issues. I pay my rent, maintain my apartment, and keep a very low profile. The staff is rude and can never give you a direct answer. They take their time with repairs; you have to make at least 3 request before it actually gets done. In June they put a note on my door stating that my January rent was short by $450.  Right, WTH. Mind you, anytime you are short or late they absolutely will not accept a partial payment; Under no circumstances. I have never had any issues paying my rent and do not why they waited 5 months to notify me they lost my payment and now telling me I need to put a trace on the money order. CourtHouse here I come.
