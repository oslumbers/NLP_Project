I used Groupon to eat there food. Omg no wonder why they don't have customers. While I was there for 35 minutes I did not see any body come in.  I had two orders and They gave me its most likely 1 1/2 scoops of each order. And one very small rice. I asked the guy I have two orders right and he said yes this is two. I looked at him he knew exactly why I asked him. Quickly he replied here is the rice. I said Omgosh to him and just walked out. People might go there for the first time but believe me customers will never go back there. One of them is me!!!!!!!! I would not recommend this place to anyone. It's not worth it.
