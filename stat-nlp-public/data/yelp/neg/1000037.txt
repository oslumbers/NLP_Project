My wife and I went there last night for our 17th anniversary. For $18 I was looking forward to the buttermilk chicken and it was AWFUL  wasn't no flavor and it wasn't crispy at all. For $18 you get a chicken breast and two sides and I was expecting a lot more for that price. I must admit the fries and macaroni and cheese was great and that's about it.  Too much hype for that place.
