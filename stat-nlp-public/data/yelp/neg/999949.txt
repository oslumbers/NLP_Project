Disappointed. The food wasn't cooked to order. My husband ordered a burger med rare, was delivered med well. Food wasn't hot. I ordered a pretzel with cheese, the cheese was good but the pretzel was awful! Seemed like a frozen pretzel barely warmed. I ditched the pretzel and stole my husbands fries to dip in the cheese instead. Will cross thirsty lion off my list and never go back. Waste of money.
