The sign says Tuscan Cuisine, but it really isn't very Tuscan. They brought me some "Faccacio bread", but it was far too soft and gaumy to be Faccacio. The "dipping sauce" was oil with sun dried tomato, not olive oil as you would find in your usual Italian restaurant. After talking with the waitress I ordered the Wild Mushroom Ravioli with steak tips. It cam with far too much cheese sauce and was more lava than ravioli. Even the glass of Sangiovese wasn't that great. Maybe I am too picky being Italian and having been to Tuscany over a dozen times. I imagine some would like the style but not me.
