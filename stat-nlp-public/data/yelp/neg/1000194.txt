Simple five (5) item order.  Had someone sick that had not eaten in a couple days and wanted a burrito.  Guess what, got 4 items- no burrito.  Was not busy and was not slow this time.  TB made a little extra on that order - will not go back.  A very good reason for no more min wage increases.  If you cannot count, should be back in school.
