So I went online to see movie times and chose my movie after watching several trailers. I waited in my room until about 20 minutes before the start of the movie and when I arrived they informed me they cancelled the movie showing for the day. NO update on the website. I was forced to choose another movie (if I wanted to still go to a movie) and I had to choose a movie that had already started and missed the first 5 minutes or so. Really poorly run establishment as the cashier told me the reason was the theatre was broken and after the movie when I spoke to a supervisor they said it was a mandate from the studio. So I guess they will say whatever they feel will silence me.
