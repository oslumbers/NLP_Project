I update this to 2 stars, as one of the supervisors came out and was personable and tried real hard. We still couldn't get the drain fixed, and HSA denied more work. We were going to try one more time but I ended up filing a Better Business Bureau claim against HSA and they sent another firm in finally, for no additional charge. So 23 days after my initial claim, the issue got fixed. Talking to various contractors, they also experience the horrible phone queue that HSA customers experience. I am unable to find HSA in Yelp, so I apologize for merging topics. Home Warranty companies is a huge sector of repair work. I will re-search Yelp as HSA deserves some critical reviewing.
