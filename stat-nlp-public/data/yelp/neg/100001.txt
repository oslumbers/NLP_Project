So disappointing we went there to waste time because we were waiting for the shuttle back to the airport after a week of fabulous food this was such a let down first we waited 15 minutes for a table at the edge to ppl watch y it took 15 minute I have no idea y no one was sitting there . We figured we get a couple appetizer since we would b getting to the airport early and thought we would eat there which turned out awful since they have NO restaurant in the airport . So back to the bad service and terrible food  we got the bbq nachos and wing both we average at best . For someone who goes all over tasting to best food u think he would pick up some tips on what good food is because this is far from good .if you want a good mesl go to the yard house great food and reasonable priced skip this place shame on him
