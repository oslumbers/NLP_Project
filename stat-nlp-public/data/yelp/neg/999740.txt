Please hello my name is Maurice I went to eat dinner with my daughter and my son it was the worst dinner I've ever had in my life the sushi was hot the hot stuff was cold the service was ridiculous the crab legs the gentleman that brought out the crab legs put off six crabs leg and then he staring at everybody because we couldn't take more than one he wouldn't let us the place is awful it's dirty the food stinks the people are nasty and its not only overpriced but it should be close down I don't recommend it to anyone at all for any reason and good luck to whoever is there and comes out alive
