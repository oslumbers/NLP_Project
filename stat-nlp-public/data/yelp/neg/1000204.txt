Way below average.  They forgot half my order. The wings were small and not meaty. The sauces were not tasty.  We couldn't even tell which sauce was which after tasting them. The prices were decent for wings, but not these wings. Don't think people who gave this restaurant a good review have ever had a wing before.  Best part of the meal was the coleslaw. Maybe that's what they should rename the restaurant.
