Just thinking back on this food makes me want to vomit! The various meat was indistinguishable..is it chicken? is it pork? who cares, it's a surprise! A surprise to your stomach that will promptly try to cleanse itself from this garbage by making you vomit for 24 hours. The food here makes Panda Express seem like a Michelin 5 star restaurant.
