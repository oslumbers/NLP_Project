I will never go to this location again! 

It was my boyfriend's birthday so I decided to surprise him with his favorite Wing Stop. Because I wanted to get home early I ordered online so I wouldn't have to wait that long.

I waited for about 10 minutes and thought I would grab a bottled IBC root beer. The cashier did not know how to ring it up so he had to call over another staff. I saw them stare at the register and finally rang up a root beer for 3.75. He ws really rude and had no idea what he was doing. 

I guess I have to go to Trop for wings!
