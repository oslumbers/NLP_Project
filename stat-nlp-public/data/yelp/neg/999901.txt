This is the worst el Pollo Loco I have ever been to. Not because of the food but the employees. They have attitudes and like to use profanity to their customers just because I had to make an adjustment to my order. The manager said he can say whatever he wants. What?! The manager is a young girl with a horrible attitude. First el Pollo Loco on this side of town, thanks for the nasty employees!
